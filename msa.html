        <p>Your lover</p>
        <p>Yet your second best</p>
        <p>Your sun</p>
        <p>But not the light</p>
        <p>But don't you worry</p>
        <p>I'm used to it</p>
        <p>Ever since I was a child</p>
        <p>to them times when I couldn't have anything in mind</p>
        <p>but I still knew</p>
        <p>wasn't new</p>
        <p>The child that grew up</p>
        <p>as a dull spark</p>
        <p>always left there alone in the beautiful park</p>
        <p>when they could take me with them</p>
        <p>was still left there alone</p>
        <p>but my eyes never shed tears</p>
        <p>my heart wasn't broken into million pieces</p>
        <p>do you wonder when all that happend</p>
        <p>when my heart burnt and the eyes with tears filled</p>
        <p>it was you the whole reason</p>
        <p>yes</p>
        <p>oh yes to be the girl</p>
        <p>the only that you would always think about</p>
        <p>write about</p>
        <p>sing about</p>
        <p>cry about</p>
        <p>but i know</p>
        <p>but i know</p>
        <p>oh boy do I know</p>
        <p>though this is all</p>
        <p>your the one that my heart always call</p>
        <p>because you made me feel like the sun,the moon and all</p>
        <p>made me feel like not the dull spark</p>
        <p>wasn't the one who would leave me alone in that flower filled beautiful park</p>
        <p>but boy was I fool</p>
        <p>thinking I'm always the one</p>
        <p>like the sun</p>
        <p>yet not the light</p>
        <p>the untouched freshly book</p>
        <p>that you will never read</p>
        <p>yeah you told me you picked me out of all them stars</p>
        <p>and even defined me as the moon of your world</p>
        <p>but little did I know I was your Venus.</p>

        <p>reasons why I wrote this poem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>past experience</li>
            <li>hopless romantic</li>
            <li>for people who don't feel like they are special or pretty enough</li>
        </ul>
        <p>friendly reminder<3</p>
          <p>You are beyond special more than you can think. Please do not let other people's thoughts and words define you.</p>
          <p>Take care of yourself,always</p>
          <p>I love you!</p>
